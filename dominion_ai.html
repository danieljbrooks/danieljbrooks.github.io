          <!-- Post Content -->
	  <p>The development of AI for games such as Go, chess, and poker has made great strides in recent years, with AI 
	  now able to defeat some of the strongest human players. Relatively little work has been done on more modern games, which frequently 
	  feature the release of additional content and hidden information. Following the approach of the draftsim model, this problem can be approached by
	  making "easy" decisions with a rules based model and answering the "hard" questions with learning methods.</p>
	 
          <p>An application of this approach is applied to 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)" target="_blank">Dominion</a>, a popular and pioneering deckbuilding
	  game released by Donald X. Vaccarino. The game revolves
	  around building a deck containing action and treasure cards, which do useful things, and victory 
	  cards, which score points at the end of the game. A number of dominion simulators have been developed, however, these tools
	  focus primarily on simple money strategies as opposed to the complex engine decks with flourish at higher levels of play.</p>
	  
          <p>I am currently working with a team of five Caltech graduate students on building more sophisticated AI for
	  dominion, focused on blending rules-based and learning based decisions. I bring substantial competitive experience
	  to the team as the <a href="http://dominion.lauxnet.com/live_leaderboard/" target="_blank">
          top ranked</a> dominion player for much of 2017-2018, as well as winning the
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deuJLiFhEFM#t=235m" target="_blank">
	  Dominion Online Championship</a>.</p>
	  
	  <p>An example of the interface for human-bot games is shown below:</p>

          <!-- Blog Post -->
          <div class="card mb-4">
            <img class="card-img-top" src="images/dominion_gui.jpg" alt="Player-bot interface for dominion">
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">Dominion interface for human-bot games implemented using the pygame python package.</p>
	    </div>
         </div>

          <p>A number of bots have been implemented in the pygame framework:</p>
	  <ul>
            <li>Random bot - baseline, makes all decisions randomly</li>
	    <li>Treasure bot - buys only basic treasure and victory cards</li>
	    <li>Big money bot - buys basic actions and treasures, empirical parameters</li>
	    <li>Village bot (in progress) - plays complex, multi-component engines</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>When purchasing cards, village bot seeks to maximize
	  payload, defined as a function of coins, buys, cards gained,
	  attacks played, cards trashed, and VP gained. The value of trashing junk cards increases early 
	  in the game, and the value of VP gaining is increased later in the game, as opponents begin 
	  to threaten to end the game. To simplify the payload computation, the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_field_theory" target="_blank">mean field approximation</a> 
	  is made to describe the distribution of additional +Cards, +Actions, and payload within a deck.</p>

	  <p>Decisions on how to play action cards are handled with a simple set of heuristics. Work has begun on implementing 
	  methods to determine the impact of individual buy and play decisions using 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search" target="_blank">Monte Carlo tree search</a> and 
	  to examine the effect of overall model parameters on winrate using 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm" target="_blank">genetic algorithms</a>. As work continues,
	  it will be interesting to explore the range of effectiveness of rules-based and learning methods 
	  for dominion and to find the combination of methods best suited for practical application.</p>
