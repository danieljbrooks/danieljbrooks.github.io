	  <p>The development of AI for games such as Go, chess, and poker has made great strides in recent years, with AI 
	  now able to defeat some of the strongest human players. Relatively little work has been done on more modern games, which frequently 
	  feature the release of additional content and hidden information. Following the approach of the draftsim model, this problem can be approached by
	  making "easy" decisions with a rules based model and answering the "hard" questions with learning methods.</p>
	  
          <p>An application of this approach to Dominion, a popular and pioneering deckbuilding game released by Donald X. Vaccarino
	  in 2008. The game revolves around building a deck containing action and treasure cards, which do useful things, and victory 
	  cards, which score points at the end of the game. A number of dominion simulators have been developed, however, these tools
	  focus primarily on simple money strategies as opposed to the complex engine decks with flourish at higher levels of play.</p>

	  <p>To begin this project, I started by studying the theory of the game, reading up on the <a href="http://dominionstrategy.com" target="_blank">dominion strategy</a> and playing games on the online currently, currently located at <a href="http://dominion.games" target="_blank">dominion.games</a>. Over time, I got better and better at navigating boards with complex engine decks. In 2017, I became the #1 ranked player and won the Dominion Online <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deuJLiFhEFM?t=3h54m7s" target="_blank"> Championship</a></p>
