	  <p>Draft simulators are widely used training tools in the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en" 
	  target="_blank">Magic: the Gathering</a> community. Many other draft
	  simulators have somewhat limited features, so I designed and built a draft
	  simulator with smart computer opponents, pick suggestions, and automatic deckbuilding. 
	  This simulator, <a href="http://draftsim.com" target="_blank">draftsim</a>, was quickly
	  adopted by the community and is currently the leading free tool for draft preparation.</p>
         
          <div class="card mb-4">
	    <img class="card-img-top" src="images/draftsim_community2.jpg" alt="Draftsim community impact">
	  </div>

	  <p>The draftsim model is designed to mimic the behavior of professional players and
	  aims to maximize the quality of cards within a two color pair. Recommended picks
	  are shown in a table on the site and there are computer draft opponents who always make
	  the most recommended pick. Decks are automatically 
	  constructed by identifying the two colors with the best cards and playing the highest rated
	  cards in those colors.</p>

	  <p>The valuation of cards is a sum of two components, a <i>base rating</i>, intrinsic
	  to the card, and a <i>color bonus</i>, which provides an incentive to draft cards from
	  a two color pair. The base ratings for each set can largely be derived from  
	  <a href="https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/a-pick-order-list-for-magic-origins/"
          target="_blank">pick order lists</a>, although some fine tuning can be done based on trends in 
          professional 
	  <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer.asp?draftid=7_31_2015_1"
          target="_blank">draft viewers</a>, community articles, or experience on the simulator. Generally
          speaking consistent cards like creatures and removal spells should be rated slightly higher
	  and situational cards like combat tricks should be rated slightly lower than the 
	  professional pick order list to ensure the construction of functional decks. A complete list
	  of draftsim card ratings can be found
	  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1umtr9q6gg_5BGAWB0n-468RP5h4gcaFg98tW52GXrFE"
	  target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
          
          <div class="card mb-4">
	    <img class="card-img-top" src="images/draftsim_model.jpg" alt="The Draftsim model considers both the intrinsic
	    value of cards and how they fit into a two color deck.">
	  </div>

	  <p>The drafting process is broken down into two
	  stages - the <i>speculation</i> stage and the <i>committed</i> stage.</p>
          
	  <p>During the <i>speculation</i> stage, the model searches for two open colors to play.
	  When a player picks a card, that player's <i>commitment</i> to the card's colors is increased
	  by (<i>rating - baseline</i>), where <i>baseline</i>=2.0. 
	  Thus, a replacement level card with <i>rating</i>=2.0
	  won't draw the model into new colors, but a bomb rare with <i>rating</i>=5.0 will.</p>

	  <p>As a player's <i>commitment</i> to a color grows from 0 to <i>threshold</i>=3.5, the
	  <i>color bonus</i> for cards of that color grows linearly from 0 to <i>max bonus</i>=+0.9 before
	  capping off. At that point, the player is considered <i>committed</i> to that color. To help find
	  a second color, the bonus of the color with second highest <i>commitment</i> is increased to 
	  0.8 * <i>max bonus</i>. When the player is either <i>committed</i> to two or more colors or the
	  draft has progressed the fourth pick of the second pack,
	  the model enters the <i>committed stage</i>.</p>
          
	  <p>During the <i>committed stage</i>, the model priotizes cards in the two color pair that the
	  player is most <i>committed</i> to. These cards are given a large <i>on color bonus</i>=+2.0. Off 
	  color cards are assigned an <i>off color</i> penalty of -1 for each off color mana symbol beyond 
	  the first.</p>
          
          <p>The above description holds for single-colored cards. Colorless cards are given a bonus equal
	  to the largest bonus available to single-colored cards.</p>
	  <p>Multicolored cards are handled differently. During the <i>committed stage</i>, multicolored 
	  cards with 2-3 colors are either given an <i>on color bonus</i>=+2.0 or 
	  the <i>off color penalty</i> described 
	  above. During the <i>speculation stage</i>, these multicolored cards are assigned a bonus equal to the
	  sum of <i>color bonuses</i> in the card's colors, minus the sum of <i>color bonuses</i> outside of 
	  the card's colors, and minus a <i>multicolored penalty</i>=-0.6. 
	  Multi-colored cards with 4-5 colors will not
	  be played by the model and are assigned no bonuses or penalities.</p>

	  <p>The draftsim model is then used to automatically construct decks for the user and the computer
	  opponents. First, the strongest color pair is identified as the two colors with the highest
	  <i>color commit</i>. The
	  highest rated on-color cards are added to the deck until there are 23 nonland cards. A total of 17
	  lands are then added to the deck, split as evenly as possible and favoring the color with 
	  greater <i>color commit</i> in the case of a uneven split.</p>

	  <p>Work is currently underway to consider the effect of additional factors such as curve and 
	  synergy. To train these parameters, drafting data will be collected from users on the site and
	  from user uploaded drafts played on the official Magic Online
	  <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-products-game-info" target="_blank">
	  client</a>. This data can be used to train more sophisticated drafting models, allow users to
          play against a variety of opponents, and provide insights into the drafting stratgies employed
	  by a wide range of users.</p>
