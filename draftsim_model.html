	  <p>Draft simulators are widely used training tools in the Magic: the Gathering community. Many other draft
	  simulators have limited functionality. I built a fully featured draft simulator with smart computer
	  opponents, pick suggestions, and automatic deckbuilding. The <a href="http://draftsim.com">tool</a> was quickly
	  adopted by the community and is currently the leading free tool for preparing for Magic: the Gathering drafts.</p>
          
	  <p>The Draftsim model is designed to mimic the behavior of professional players and
	  maximizes the quality of cards within a two color pair. Each card has a base rating 
	  and a color bonus, which scales up as more cards of that color are picked. Recommended picks are shown in
	  a table on the site, computer opponents always make the most recommended pick. Decks are automatically 
	  constructed by identifying the two colors with the best cards and playing the highest rated
	  cards in those colors.</p>

	  <p>The valuation of cards is a sum of two components, a <i>base rating</i>, intrinsic
	  to the card, and a <i>color bias</i>, which provides an incentive two draft cards from
	  a two-color pair. The base ratings for each set can largely be derived from pick order 
	  <a href="https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/a-pick-order-list-for-magic-origins/"
          target="_blank">lists</a>, although some fine tuning can be done based on trends in 
          professional draft 
	  <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer.asp?draftid=7_31_2015_1"
          target="_blank">viewers</a>, community articles, or experience on the simulator. Generally
          speaking consistent cards like creatures and removal spells should be rated slightly higher
	  and situational cards like combat tricks should be rated slightly lower than the 
	  professional pick order list to ensure the construction of functional decks.</p>

	  <p>To identify two open colors to play, the drafting process is broken down into two
	  stages - the <i>speculation</i> stage where the model searches for two open colors and the
	  <i>committed</i> stage where the model prioritizes cards of those colors.</p>

	  <p>Work is currently underway to consider the effect of additional factors such as curve and 
	  synergy. To train these parameters, drafting data will be collected from users on the site and
	  from user uploaded drafts played on the official Magic Online
	  <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-products-game-info" target="_blank">
	  client</a>. This data can be used to train more sophisticated drafting models, allow users to
          play against a variety of opponents, and provide insights into the drafting stratgies employed
	  by a wide range of users.</p>
